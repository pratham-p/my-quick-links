# Privacy Policy for My Quick Links
_Last updated: October 2025_

## Overview
My Quick Links is a browser extension that allows users to create and manage quick shortcut links (for example, typing `my google` to open Google).  
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This document explains how data is handled by the extension.

---

## Data Collection and Usage
My Quick Links **does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information, browsing history, or user data**.

All information you create within the extension (such as custom link mappings) is stored **locally on your device** using the browser’s built-in storage APIs (`chrome.storage.local` and `chrome.storage.sync`).

Your data:
- Remains fully under your control.
- Never leaves your browser or device.
- Is not transmitted to any external servers or third parties.

---

## Permissions
The extension requests minimal permissions:
- **`storage`** — to save your custom links locally or sync them across your Chrome profiles.
- **`tabs`** — to open or redirect to the saved destination URLs when you use your quick links.

These permissions are only used to provide the core functionality of the extension.

---

## Data Sync (Optional)
If you enable Chrome Sync, the extension may use `chrome.storage.sync` to synchronize your quick link data between Chrome browsers signed into the same Google account.  
This is handled entirely by Google’s infrastructure and follows [Google Chrome’s privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

---

## Third-Party Services
My Quick Links does not use any analytics, tracking scripts, or third-party services.
